# humsafar
A Python speech recognition based chatbot that tells story based on traditional Indian toys.


Our humsafar uses the following modules to gather and process its information from:
1. python speech recognition- speechrecognition - used for speech recognition
2. python text to speech - pyttsx3 - used for text to speech
3. wikipedia - wikipedia - lets the program search through wikipedia for information
4. webbrowser - to open various web browser related websites such as youtube and spotify
5. datetime - used to provide date and time
6. request - lets u request HTTP data that returns HTTP objects
7. tkinter -  to create a graphical user interface
8. smtplib - smtp client session object that can be used to send email to any machine using smtp or estmp listener daemon


furthermore, we use the speech recognition to recognise the speaker speech and provide appropriate answers to their query if within humsafar's domain, following was our agenda or the inspiration to make the chatbot:
1. Making our own alexa like system.
2. A chat bot that can provide the young generation with the information about our traditional toys such as lattoos, gilli danda and what not.
3. the chatbot does all this while providing the basic functionality of a chat bot.

A .docx files of all the keywords for toys presently accepted by humsafar is provided in the repository under the name of project humsafar.docx. Kindly go through it to have a smooth experience humsafar


further improvisations that we are planning to bring to humsafar but cant rightnow due to tight deadline/lack of knowledge are:
1. Add tales like panchtantra and other folk tales to teach younger generation about our tradition.
2. Develop a system that acts like a friend for the child so that parent doesnot have to look after the kid that much,keeps the child busy.
3. provide the kids daily life knowledge and manners in a friendlier way.
4. Have an inbuilt activity tracker to track what the child is doing and at what time to create a routine for them.
5. overall helping the parents do better parenting while spending less time.


how we plan to do the above improvisations are a different task though as we lack knowledge to completely implement the above improvisations. We plan to expand our knowledge in the field of ML and AI and then implement the same knowledge to further improve our and yours only HUMSAFAR.
